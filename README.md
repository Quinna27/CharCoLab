Due to the complexity of the AutoGen framework, this project has been directly developed within its codespace. 
If you wish to run or modify the project for your own purposes, I recommend using the AutoGen codespace, which can be found in official github: https://github.com/microsoft/autogen
Additionally, ensure you update the OAI_CONFIG_LIST with your own API key to enable proper functionality.
